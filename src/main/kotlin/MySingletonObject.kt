object MySingletonObject {
//    We can create a singleton object, which means we can only have ONE INSTANCE of this object
//    This is useful when we want to have a global object that can be accessed from anywhere in the code
    //For example, we can create a singleton object that represents the current user
    //We can access this object from anywhere in the code and we can be sure that there is only one instance of this object

    //We can create a singleton object by using the object keyword
    //here user is some example of a singleton object

    val PI = 3.14
    //now we can access this variable from anywhere in the code
